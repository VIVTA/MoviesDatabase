# Questions

* In general, should we have a _staff page_ and a _ticket desk page_ that has many different forms for the functionality described by the font-end and back-end sections? Or a different page for each possible function?

E.g:
> _List all movies either by year or alphabetically_  
> A page for all movies ordered by year **AND** a page for all movies ordered alphabetically by name  
> **OR**  
> A staff page which let's the staff choose whether to list all movies by year or by name and then click submit to see the list?
